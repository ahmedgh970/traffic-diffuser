## Abstract

Accurate trajectory prediction in multi-agent environments is essential for advancing autonomous vehicles and ensuring safe robotic control. Current traffic simulation methods rely on latent features or dense goal candidates for predicting future trajectories, but they face limitations in scalability, adaptability, and fine-tuning, making it difficult to balance prediction quality with efficiency. The core idea of this project is to leverage recent advances in diffusion modeling to generate future trajectories. However, this task is complex due to two main challenges: first, the multimodal nature of future trajectories, driven by the unpredictable and varied intentions of agents; second, the need to efficiently learn a representation that captures the joint distribution of contextual, social, and temporal information for accurate, context-aware predictions in planning and decision-making. To this end, we introduce TrafficDiffuser, a scene-centric conditional diffusion model that handles multiple agents with varying sequence lengths, conditioned on historical trajectories and map context. This method offers several important advantages: first, it learns a highly diverse distribution, capturing a wide range of potential future outcomes. Second, the model leverages a straightforward conditional transformer backbone, enabling it to generate realistic trajectories based on the specific characteristics of each agent. We use ScenarioNet to unify various benchmark datasets, mitigating performance drops when transferring evaluations between datasets. Expanding data size and diversity significantly enhances model performance.
